# Acoustic Source Localization with Deep Neural Networks utilizing Binaural Parameters

### Abstract (Translated)

In this work a novel compression method of the ILD and ITD binaural parameters is proposed.
The goal of this method is the optimal utilization of those parameters to train DNNs or other Machine Learning methods.
Two DNN models are trained, one fully connected with a structure similar to that of a Multi-Layered Perceptron and a Convolutional Neural Network with the goal of estimating the Direction of Arrival of an acoustic excitation, in real rooms with reverberation, from the dimensionally reduced parameters.

The models achieve excellent performance with the Mean Absolute Error being less than 5<sup>o</sup> via the utilization of the parameters compressed by a factor of ~88%.
The Direction of Arrival proposed in this work, utilizing machine learning methods, surpass traditional DoA estimation approaches, both in the time required for the estimation and the results achieved.
